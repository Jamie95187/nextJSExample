# NextJs Example

next,js is a React library that can be used for routing pages without using React Router manually. With a specific file layout.

## Styling in next.js

**Can** still use:

- inline styles
- radium
- styled-jsx package (can be found on github)

**Can not** use:

- CSS modules (because cant use the webpack configuration that next.js uses)

## Deployment

Need a host that can run Node.js .

`npm run build`
